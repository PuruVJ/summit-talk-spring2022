# Early Days (React)

- Built with React
- Styling Solution done using @mui/styles (v4, deprecated in v5)
- Dock animation done with Framer Motion

## Features:

- Dock with animation
- Static Toolbar(Non-interactive)

# Network Requests were!

<img src="/react-1-network-requests.png" class="h-[50vh]" />

<!-- As you can see, we have a giant list of requests. This is the nature of Snowpack by default. Snowpack, even in prod ships separate files as ESM. Which is not great with these many files, as even with HTTP2, these many requests are simply not as fast as one single minified file. -->

---
layout: fact

## And the dock animation was janky.

<!--

Dock animation works by changing the width of the individual images. So, changing widths of 7 images at once, listening to mouse hover event, and then the actual width change causing re-layout makes it drops frames. Not to mention, the whole song and dance of React's Virtual DOM.

The GIF you saw before looks smooth because it is captured on a macbook pro, but the machine I developed this version on was 700USD windows machine that frankly wasn't very good -->

# Hello Vite

<!-- Around February of last year, I found out about this fun little thing you might've heard of: Vite. Vite is a all-in-one bundler/dev server/build tool combined into one little delightful package! Vite is very similar to Snowpack, but much more polished, and it bundles everything into file in production. Do you see where I'm going with this? -->

# Size reduction by 16KB

Vite bundles everything into one big bundle, removing the extra `import`, `export` statements, and the headers per file aren't sent too.
<!-- 16KB minified + brotli reduction is very very good, or just changing the bundler. It was also possible due to Vite's asset handling, so rather than.

  finder: {
    icon: FinderIcon,

  calculator: {

  // ...
}
```

</v-click>

<style>
.slidev-layout {
  gap: 2rem;
  align-items: center;
}
</style>

<!--
And, because of how Vite handles assets, it's possible to use the image by a path relative to public folder directly. With that feature, the code went from this *Queue the code snippet* to this: ->

And, because, I followed the convention of storing the icons as the same name as key in the config object, I got rid of even the icon property ->

```svelte

# Era of Preact

<v-click>

## (And all it took was changing one file üòâ)

</v-click>

<!--

In React ecosystem, the most recommended method to increase perf is to move to Preact. So that's what I did.

# vite.config.ts

::right::

```diff
- import reactRefresh from '@vitejs/plugin-react-refresh';
+ import preact from '@preact/preset-vite';
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
- plugins: [reactRefresh()],
+ plugins: [preact()],
- esbuild: {
-   jsxInject: `import React from 'react';`,
- },
});
```

<!--

All I had to do was install the `@preactjs/preset-vite`, and replace the `reactRefresh` with `preact`, imported from `@preact/preset-vite`. And it's done!

This plugin automatically did the proper aliasing of `react` and `react-dom` to `preact/compat`, so I did not even have to change the imports or anything.

# Bundle size went down by 37KB!

### Bringing it to 110KB

Yes, bundle size before was 130KB, so the math doesn't exactly work. I had added a few more features, which resulted in a bigger bundle size. But, it's still a huge difference.

# Goodbye styled-components üè≥

<!-- Writing styles as JS object is not fun. Not at all. So, after I moved the app to Preact, I also migrated the styles to styled-components, so I could write some sane CSS.

Folks, CSS as JS objects is overrated

# Issues with Styled Components

- CSS in JS
- Need VSCode extension
- Not super great performance
- Doesn't minify
- 12KB min+gzip

<!-- CSS in JS - Not really great experience in general. Something about writing CSS inside the .ts feels wrong. Uncanny.

- Need VSCode extension - Remember the code snippet you saw before of styled-components? Notice the CSS in it was not syntax highlighted? This is true for VSCode as well. You need styled components extension to get the highlight, intellisense and all the things that make CSS support great

- Not super great performance - Because Styled Components create the styles using JS, it always slower than just providing the plain CSS on demand. OFC, this point is not very important for this project, as I never saw styled-components as a runtime perf bottleneck
-->

# Doesn't minify

<img src="/styled-comps-unminified.png" style="background-color: white" />

<!-- What you are seeing os the final index.js bundle of the app. As you can see, there is a lot of minified js, and then you have the raw CSS written inside the js. Frankly, it looks ugly and makes the bundle size bigger for no reason. 

And yes, I tried the babel-plugin-styled-components to minify the template CSS. Didn't work with Vite, so had to make do without it.

# <span text="red-300">110KB</span><span class="font-mono"> -> </span><span text="orange-400">85KB</span>

## (And added .css of 3.3KB)

</v-click>

<!-- This move brought the bundle size down from 110KB to 85KB, with a sprinkle of 3.3KB of CSS.

But more than that, it was now easier for browser too. All needed now was to parse the CSS in background and be prepared. The JS had no more control over the CSS, hence it was overall more performant than before.

# Go Code splitting üíîüññ

<!--

Finally, I was at a point where I couldn't make the app smaller by removing dependencies anymore. Those dependencies were extremely essential for the app to work. 

So finally, I resorted to code splitting the app away using React Suspense. Up until now, all the apps were loaded on the initial load only, which wasn't needed if you don't even open the apps

-->

---

```tsx
import { AppID } from '__/stores/apps.store';
import { lazy } from 'react';

type AppNexusProps = {
  appID: AppID,
  isBeingDragged: boolean,
};

const Calculator = lazy(() => import('./Calculator/Calculator'));
const VSCode = lazy(() => import('./VSCode/VSCode'));
const Calendar = lazy(() => import('./Calendar/Calendar'));

const PlaceholderApp = lazy(() => import('./Placeholder/Placeholder'));

export const AppNexus = ({ appID, isBeingDragged }: AppNexusProps) => {
  if (appID === 'calculator') return <Calculator />;
  if (appID === 'vscode') return <VSCode isBeingDragged={isBeingDragged} />;
  if (appID === 'calendar') return <Calendar />;

  return <PlaceholderApp appID={appID} />;
};
```

<!--

This here is the `AppNexus` component. Why Nexus? Nexus in science fiction and fantasy is a world between worlds, a room with doors in it, to leads to other worlds. This is what AppNexus does. This component is responsible for loading the right app when it is requested.

-->

---
layout: fact

# <span text="orange-400">85KB</span><span class="font-mono"> -> </span><span text="green-300">62KB</span>

<!--

This move brought down the bundle size down immensely. Just 62KB on first load was a really good comparison. It's literally 2.5x smaller than the initial version.

# 12th Aug <span font="mono">-></span> 13th Aug

<!--

On 12th of August, I started migrating the app from React to Svelte. I started with copying the plain JS files first, then the React ones as `.svelte` files. I would paste the content of the React file, and start removing the JSX-specific code from it. File by file.

And by the night of 13th, I was fully done with the refactor. Everything done in just 2 days. This is giant benefit of the modern web development. We maye argue howone framework is better than others, but in the grand scheme of things all are similar enough, and it is a boon for people like me who like to migrate things over to other libraries.
